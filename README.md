## Decent Art

This repository contains SVG and PNG files of the Decent logo in three forms - [dark](dark.svg.png), [light](light.svg.png), and [neither](logo.svg.png). The two colours used in these logos are:

* `#337df4` - light
* `#1f2f48` - dark

> **Note:** you're free to use these logos however you like, but we'd appreciate if they were only used for Decent-related projects and don't imply that we (the Decent maintainers) created your project.

Feel free to use these logos in client implementations and the like! :ok_woman:

## Key points

* :ok_hand: looks suspiciously like a 'd' (**d**ecent)
* Not very complicated - easy to recognise
* The symbol often means something similar to 'decent' (ie. okay, fine, perfect)

## License

The Decent logo is based off of the old :ok_hand: glyph from [Google's noto-emoji set](https://github.com/googlei18n/noto-emoji/), which is under the **Apache License 2.0**. Likewise, this repository is licensed under the same license.
